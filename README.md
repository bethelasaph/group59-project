# group59-project
First Capstone Landing Page project done by Group 59 on Side Hustle Internship.
Team Lead: BETHEL ASAPH
We divided the project in sections and assigned each to the team members available
We used flexbox and a little bit of CSS grid to properly layout items and elements in the project.
We also added a custom animation, kind of like a fadein, to further beautify our project, along with some cool hover effects on the anchor tags
On the cta(call-to-action) button, we added a cool animation to the button.
More importantly, we made the site mobile responsive and also responsive on desktop.
